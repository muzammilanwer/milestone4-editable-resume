# milestone4-editable-resume

Welcome to Milestone 4 of the Dynamic Resume Builder! In this version, weâ€™ve introduced the ability for users to directly edit sections of the generated resume, ensuring that all changes are reflected immediately without reloading the page. This project is part of the Hackathon challenge, and it builds on previous milestones to offer enhanced interactivity and flexibility for users.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The Editable Dynamic Resume Builder allows users to generate a resume based on form input and then directly edit sections (e.g., Education, Work Experience) of the generated resume. Changes made by users are reflected instantly without needing to refresh or reload the page, creating a smooth and seamless experience.

ðŸŒŸ New Features in Milestone 4
Editable Sections: Users can click on any section (Personal Information, Education, Work Experience, Skills) of the generated resume and edit the details directly.
Instant Updates: Changes to the resume are reflected immediately without the need to reload the page.
Enhanced User Experience: The dynamic nature of the resume builder allows for easy, on-the-fly editing, providing a more flexible and user-friendly interface.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
HTML: Structure and content of the form and resume.
CSS: Styling and layout.
TypeScript: Manages the dynamic editing functionality and instant updates to the resume.
